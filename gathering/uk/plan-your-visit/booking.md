Tickets for the MathsJam Gathering include sessions on the Saturday and Sunday, as well as lunches on both days, dinner on Saturday and overnight accommodation onsite for Saturday night.

The cost of a **full weekend ticket** is **£190** (single occupancy) or **£310** (for two people sharing a double or twin room). If you are booking a double or twin, you should book one ticket and it will cover both of your attendance.

**Non-residential tickets**, covering the daytime sessions and meals, but not including overnight accommodation, are available at **£90** for the whole weekend.

**Remote attendance tickets** are available for **£20**, and include online access to the livestream of the event, access to the [Virtual MathsJam gather.town space](https://app.gather.town/app/MTCdhLpepRbaogJV/virtual-yarnfield) during the weekend of the event, and any other parts of the event we're able to make accessible remotely. For more information, see the [remote attendance page]({{site.url}}/gathering/uk/plan-your-visit/remote).

On all Gathering tickets, there are discounts of **10% for early-bird booking** (ending at noon on 30th September) and a further **10% for unwaged or low-income participants**, using the code 'unwaged'.

If you would like to attend MathsJam but would be unable to cover all the costs yourself, we may have some funding available to support you. If this is the case, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9XBy_A_5HvU0H6Jxg0njsSelPncy5GFD4DFrhBXQxAKh2mw/viewform?usp=header">complete this form</a> and we will contact you before the early-bird deadline on 30th September to confirm.

Additional nights of accommodation (for Friday and Sunday night) may be added to your booking, at a cost of £70 (single occupancy) or £60 (per person sharing). An additional meal (dinner on Friday or Sunday evening) may be added for £10 per person. Discounts are not available on these additional nights/meals.
