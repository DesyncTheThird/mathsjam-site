<h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>

The venue for the MathsJam UK Gathering is [Kents Hill Park](https://www.kentshillpark.com/), which is a large conference centre in Milton Keynes, which is halfway between London and Birmingham.

We will be in the Nightingale building, which has two floors, and the main rooms we'll use for MathsJam are on the first floor - rooms 120-130, which will be combined into one large conference room filled with round tables, and projector screens along the long side of the room.

The talks sessions will take place in the main long room, and we'll have other rooms nearby with tables of things to play with, as well as space for our competitions, and a space for the MathsJam Jam to happen in the evening.

The entrance to the venue has one step, but level access is available via the central building, with lifts are to the first floor.

<h2 id="travel">Getting There</h2>

The nearest train station is [Milton Keynes Central](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/milton-keynes-central/) (5 miles away), which is on the main line out of London Euston. Trains between Euston and Manchester, Crewe, Liverpool and Birmingham all stop at Milton Keynes, among others. 

From the station, several buses run to within walking distance of Kents Hill, including services C1, C11, X6, X91, 3 and 8. Taxis from the station to Kents Hill will take about 10 minutes.

There is free parking at the venue for anyone travelling by car (although you will need to enter your car registration at main reception or in Nightingale House on arrival).

If you have any questions about travel, or are unfamiliar with UK transport networks and would like some advice, email [gathering@mathsjam.com](mailto:gathering@mathsjam.com) and we can try to help. Information about train tickets can be found on the [National Rail website](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/tickets-railcards-and-offers/ticket-types/).

Rooms are all en-suite, and within a few minutes' walk of the main building, via a covered walkway.

<h2 id="covid">COVID Policy</h2>

The event takes place in a large conference building, which may also have other events taking place at the same time. The rooms are reasonably large, and we will aim to keep windows and doors open where possible. We will, unavoidably, still be a large group of people mixing in an indoor space. To try to make the Gathering as safe as we can while still striking a balance with fun and convenience, we have the following policy:

- We ask every attendee to have up-to-date COVID vaccinations to whatever extent is possible for them;
- We also ask people to do a rapid lateral flow test (RLFT) before coming to the event, and not to attend if it is positive.

If a positive COVID test prevents you from attending some or all of the event, we will be happy to refund all or part of your ticket as needed, and Remote Attendance is available if you still want to join in from home. We will not require people to wear masks during the event, but invite people to wear masks if they are more comfortable doing so.

If you have any questions or concerns about any of this, contact us on [gathering@mathsjam.com](mailto:gathering@mathsjam.com).

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

The venue and accommodation are all fully wheelchair accessible, with lifts to the first floor, and double doors in all corridors. Entering all the rooms is via a single door, but it is wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Accessible accommodation is available on request - please indicate on your booking if you need this, and we can pass this on to the venue.

There will be a designated Quiet Room during the event, with armchairs and tables, for people to spend time away from the main event. There are unisex accessible toilets on both floors of the conference venue.

In the room where we hold our main sessions, an induction loop system is available for hearing aids, and the contents of the main display screens (two large projectors at the front) are repeated on smaller screens further back in the room.

Assistance dogs are welcome at the venue, and there are designated car parking spaces within the main car park for Blue Badge holders.
