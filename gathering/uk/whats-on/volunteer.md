There are various aspects of the weekend for which volunteer help is needed and appreciated, including:

- fetching coffee for the speakers in the breaks so they can stay and take questions
- posting from the BigMathsJam social media accounts
- overseeing the post-talk chat sessions for remote attendees
- updating the website with talk info through GitHub
- wrangling the tech.

If you're interested in volunteering, please email [volunteer@mathsjam.com](mailto:volunteer@mathsjam.com).
